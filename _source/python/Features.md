# Sets of Features

A **feature set** represents those [`Feature`](#Feature) objects that meet certain criteria.

{% comment %}
// > .method Features(*filename*, *url*=None)
{% endcomment %}

> .method Features(*filename*)
 
Creates a feature set based on a Geographic Object Library.

```python
france = Features("france")   # All features in france.gol
```

## Filtering features

To select a subset of features, add the constraint in parentheses, or apply a filter method. This always creates a new feature set, leaving the original set unmodified.

### By bounding box

Select the features whose bounding boxes intersect the given [`Box`](#Box):  

<img class="float" src="/img/bboxes.png" width=260>

```python
paris_bounds = Box(
    west=2.2, south=48.8, 
    east=2.5, north=48.9)
features_in_paris = france(paris_bounds)
```

### By type and tags

Apply a query written in [GOQL (Geographic Object Query Language)](../goql) to select features based on their type and tags:

<img class="float" src="/img/query-type-tags.png" width=260>

```python
restaurants = features(
    "na[amenity=restaurant]")   
    # nodes and areas
    
fire_hydrants = features(
    "n[emergency=fire_hydrant]")
    # only nodes
    
safe_for_cycling = features(
   "w[highway=cycleway,path,living_street],"        
   "w[highway][maxspeed < 30]")
   # linear ways
```

### Using filter methods

Apply a [spatial filter](#spatial-filters), [geometric filter](#geometric-filters) or [topological filter](#topological-filters):

```python
states.within(usa)
features("w[highway]").members_of(route66)
```

### Using set intersection

Select only features that are in *both* sets:

```python
museums  = features("na[tourism=museum]")
in_paris = features.within(paris)
paris_museums = museums(in_paris)
```

Alternatively, you can use the `&` operator:

```python
paris_museums = museums & in_paris
```

## Obtaining `Feature` objects

Iterate through the feature set: 

```python
>>> for hotel in hotels:
...     print(hotel.name)
HÃ´tel du Louvre
Ambassadeur
Brit Hotel
```

Turn it into a `list`:

```python
>>> list(hotels)
[way/112112065, relation/1575507, node/3558592188]
```

Check if the set is empty:

```python
if pubs(within_dublin):
    print("Great, we can grab a beer in this town!")
    
if not street.nodes("[traffic_calming=bump]"):
    print("No speed bumps on this street.")
```

## Obtaining a single `Feature`

> .property first

The first feature of the set (or any arbitrary feature if the set is unordered).

`None` if the set is empty.

> .property one

The one and only feature of the set. 

A `QueryError` is raised if the set is empty or contains more than one feature.

> .end

<br> 
Alternatively, use `[0]` to get the first `Feature` of a non-empty set.

A `QueryError` is raised if the set is empty.

```python
first_node = way.nodes[0]
```

## Retrieving features by ID

<blockquote class="note" markdown="1">
GOLs currently don't index features by their ID, so ID-based lookups can be very slow, especially for large datasets. To mitigate this, constrain the set to the bounding box where the feature is expected to be located. Even merely limiting the query to a city-sized area will bring its latency to well below 1 ms. 

Query performance further improves by combining it with a tag clause for an indexed key. For example, if a requested node represents a shop, pre-filter the set with a `[shop]` query. Use [`gol info`](/gol/info) or [`indexed_keys`](#Features_indexed_keys) to determine which keys are indexed.
</blockquote>

```python
eiffel_tower = world.way(5013364)        # very slow, avoid
paris = Box(w=2.2, s=48.8, e=2.5, n=48.9)
eiffel_tower = world(paris).way(5013364) # Takes < 1 ms
eiffel_tower = world(paris)("a[tourism]").way(5013364) 
    # even faster (assuming "tourism" key is indexed)
```

> .method node(*id*)

Retrieves the node with the given ID (or `None`).

*Since 1.2*

> .method way(*id*)

Retrieves the way with the given ID (or `None`).

If you know whether the way represents a linestring or an area, you can speed up the query by restricting it with `w` or `a`:

```python
way = features('w').way(123)      # for a lineal way
way = features('a').way(123)      # for an area
```

*Since 1.2*

> .method relation(*id*)

Retrieves the relation with the given ID (or `None`).

If you know whether the relation represents a (multi)polygon or a "proper" relation (route, turn restriction, etc.), you can speed up the query by restricting it with `a` or `r`:

```python
rel = features('a').relation(123)      # for an area relation
rel = features('r').relation(123)      # for any other type
```

*Since 1.2*

## Testing for membership

To check if a feature belongs to a given set, use the `in` operator:

```python
sushi_restaurants = world("na[amenity=restaurant][cuisine=sushi]")

if restaurant in sushi_restaurants:
    print (f"{restaurant.name} serves sushi")
```

## Result properties

These are read-only, and are computed on each access.

> .property count

The total number of features in this set.

> .property area

The total area (in square meters) of all areas in this set.

> .property length

The total length (in meters) of all features in this set. For areas, their circumference
is used.

> .property shape

A `GeometryCollection` that contains the shapes of all features in this set.

## Subsets

> .property nodes

Only features that are nodes.

> .property ways

Only features that are ways (including areas that are represented using a closed way).

If you want to restrict the subset to linear ways, use <code><i>features</i>('w')</code>.

> .property relations

Only features that are relations (including relations that represent areas).

If you want to restrict the subset to non-area relations, use <code><i>features</i>('r')</code>.

## Formatting

> .property geojson

The set's features as GeoJSON ([`Formatter`](Formatter#geojson))

> .property geojsonl

The set's features as GeoJSON, with each feature on a separate line ([`Formatter`](Formatter#geojsonl))

> .property map

A [`Map`](#Map) that displays the features in this set. Use [`show()`](#Map.show) to open it in a browser window, or [`save()`](#Map.save) to write its HTML file. 

```python
restaurants.map.show()
hotels.map.save("hotel-map") # .html by default
hydrants.map(color='red')    # map with fire hydrants marked in red
```

> .property wkt

The set's features as Well-Known Text ([`Formatter`](Formatter#wkt))

## Spatial filters

These methods return a subset of only those features that fulfill a specific spatial relationship with another geometric object ([`Feature`](#Feature), [`Geometry`](#Geometry), [`Box`](#Box) or [`Coordinate`](#Coordinate)). 

> .method intersecting(*geom*)

Features whose geometry *intersects* the given geometric object.

> .method within(*geom*)

Features that lie entirely inside *geom*.



> .method around(*geom*, *units*=*distance*)

Features that lie within the given distance from the centroid of *geom*. 
In lieu of a geometric object, you can also specify coordinates using 
`x` and `y` (for Mercator-projected coordinates) or `lon` and `lat` (in degrees).
Use `meters`, `feet`, `yards`, `km`, `miles` or `mercator_units` to specify the maximum distance.

```python
# All bus stops within 500 meters of the given restaurant
features("n[highway=bus_stop]").around(restaurant, meters=500)
 
# All features within 3 miles of the given point 
features.around(miles=3, lat=40.12, lon=-76.41) 
```

> .method containing(*geom*)

Features whose geometry *contains* the given geometric object.

**Note:** If you want to test whether this set includes a particular feature, use <code><i>feature</i> in <i>set</i></code> ([See above](#testing-for-membership))

```python
# In which park (if any) is this statue of Claude Monet?
features("a[leisure=park]").containing(statue_of_monet).first

# The county, state and country for this point -- should return 
# San Diego County, California, USA (in no particular order)  
features("a[boundary=administrative]"
    "[admin_level <= 6]").containing(Coordinate(lon=-117.25, lat=32.99)) 
```

{% comment %}
```
# The county, state and country for this point -- should return 
# San Diego County, California, USA (in no particular order)  
features("a[boundary=administrative]"
    "[admin_level <= 6]").containing(lon=-117.25, lat=32.99) 
```
{% endcomment %}

*As of Version {{ site.geodesk_python_version}}, only nodes and `Coordinate`
objects are supported.*

> .method crossing(*geom*)

Features whose geometry *crosses* the given geometric object.

```python
# All railway bridges across the Mississippi River
features("w[railway][bridge]").crossing(mississippi)
```

{%comment%}

> .method disjoint_from(*geom*) 0.2

Features whose geometry is *disjoint* from the given geometric object.

> .method overlapping(*geom*) 0.2

Features whose geometry *overlaps* the given geometric object.

> .method touching(*geom*) 0.2

Features whose geometry *touches* the given geometric object.

> .method nearest_to(*geom*, *units*=*distance*) 0.2

Features in ascending order of distance to the given geometric object.

- To limit the search radius, specify a maximum distance in the units of your choice: `meters`, `feet`, `yards`, `km`, `miles` or `mercator_units`   

```python
features("na[amenity=hospital]").nearest_to(my_location, miles=5)
```

## Geometric filters

These methods return a subset of those features that have specific geometric properties.

> .method min_area(*n*)

buildings.min_area(1000)  
# Buildings with a footprint of at least a thousand square meters

world("a[place=island]").min_area(miles=500)  
# Islands that are at least 500 square miles
```

> .method max_area(*n*)
 
Features whose area is at most *n* (see `min_area` above).

```python

# Tennis courts that are no more than 2000 quare feet
```

> .method min_length(*n*)

Features whose length is at least *n*, where *n* can be meters or a specific unit (`meters`, `feet`, `yards`, `km`, `miles` or `mercator_units`).
