**GeoDesk for Python** allows you to query, analyze, display and transform OpenStreetMap features using the world's most popular scripting language.

In this Guide:

- [Quickstart](/python/quickstart): Set up Python, install GeoDesk, create your first GOL and dive straight in.
- Basic geometric objects, from [`Coordinate`](/python/Coordinate) and [`Box`](/python/Box) to the [`Geometry`](/python/Geometry) classes of the [Shapely](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/) library.
- Working with [features](/python/Feature) and [feature sets](/python/Features)
- Visualizing features on a [`Map`](/python/Map) and converting them to other [formats](/python/Formatter)
- Advanced topics, such as explicitly transforming coordinates to and from the [Mercator projection](/python/mercator)
