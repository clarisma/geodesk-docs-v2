# `gol build`

Creates a new Geo-Object Library from an OpenStreetMap data file.

Usage:

    gol build [<options>] <gol-file> <source-file>

`<gol-file>` is the name of the Library to build. If no extension is given, `.gol` will be added.

`<source-file>` is the file that contains the OpenStreetMap data. Currently, only files in [OSM-PBF format](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/PBF_Format) are supported. This format is popular due to its compact size and wide tool support.

## Sources of OpenStreetMap Data

A complete copy of the worldwide map data (updated weekly) is available for download on the [OSM website](https://planet.osm.org/). Because of the size of the download (multiple gigabytes) and limited server bandwidth, it is highly recommended to use [torrents](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Planet.osm#BitTorrent).

A better alternative may be using a [mirror](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Planet.osm#Planet.osm_mirrors), or a provider of [processed datasets](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Processed_data_providers).

If you are looking for regional or country-sized subsets, [GeoFabrik](https://download.geofabrik.de/) offers a large selection of datasets (updated daily).

## Hardware Requirements

Building a library is a resource-intense operation. To build a GOL that contains the worldwide OpenStreetMap dataset, you should have a machine with at least 8 physical cores and 24 GB of RAM, or the build process may take multiple hours. 

For smaller datasets, any reasonably modern machine will do fine (a 10-year-old dual-core laptop with 8 GB RAM will build country-size datasets such as Germany, France or Japan in about 20 minutes each). A fast solid-state drive is recommended in any case. 

Your drive should have free space equal to at least three times the size of the .osm.pbf file (in addition to that file). So if you wish to download the planet file (currently 60 GB) and turn it into a GOL, you should have 240 GB of disk space available. 

The resulting GOL itself will only be 30% to 50% larger than the planet file (The additional storage is needed to accommodate temporary files).


## Options

### <code>--areas</code> <code><em>&lt;RULES&gt;</em></code> {#option-areas}

The tags that determine whether a closed OSM way is treated as an area or a linear ring. Rules can be specified for one or more keys. A closed way is treated as an area if it fulfills at least one of these rules (or is explicitly tagged `area=yes`), and is *not* tagged `area=no`.

Key rules have the following format:

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code><i>key</i> [ <b>(</b> [ <b>except</b> ] <i>value</i>+ <b>)</b> ]
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>


Multiple key rules and values must be separated by whitespace and/or commas.

Example:


```
--areas "building, barrier (city_wall, ditch),  man_made (except embankment)   
```

The above will cause any closed way tagged `building` (except `building=no`), `barrier=city_wall`, `barrier=ditch` or `man_made` (except `man_made=embankment` or `man_made=no`) to be treated as an area.  


### `-l`, `--levels` <code><em>&lt;LIST&gt;</em></code> {#option-levels}

The zoom levels at which tile-tree nodes should be created. Together with [`--max-tiles`](#option-max-tiles) and [`--min-tile-density`](#option-min-tile-density), this setting shapes the tile structure of a GOL.

- Zoom levels must be between 0 and 12.
- The difference between zoom levels must not exceed 3 (e.g. you can specify `0,3,6,9`, but not `0,4,6,12`).
- The root level (`0`) is always included implicitly.
- Fewer zoom levels result in a flatter tree that may yield better query performance, but cause a higher variance in tile sizes.
- Setting the top zoom level too low may cause the maximum tile size (1 GB uncompressed) to be exceeded. (Very large tiles may also cause the build process to run out of memory.)

### `-m`, `--max-tiles` <code><em>&lt;NUMBER&gt;</em></code> {#option-max-tiles}

Value: 1 -- 8,000,000 (default: 65,535)

The maximum number of tiles into which the features of the GOL are organized. The actual number of tiles may be significantly less, based on [`min-tile-density`](#option-min-tile-density). A lower tile count results in a more compact GOL, while a higher tile count improves the performance of certain large-area spatial queries.

A higher setting is also preferred if you intend to host a tile repository, as a more granular tileset reduces the amount of data users will have to download for their regions of interest.

If this number is set too low, a tile may exceed the maximum size of 1 GB (uncompressed). An unreasonably low setting may also cause the build process to fail with an `OutOfMemoryError`.


### `--max-strings` <code><em>&lt;NUMBER&gt;</em></code> {#option-max-strings}

Value: 256 -- 65,535 (default: 16,384)

The maximum number of strings that will be stored in the GOL's Global String Table. A higher value results in a smaller GOL file and increased query performance. (Loading a larger string table consumes more memory and may cause a slight delay when opening a GOL file, but the impact of this is generally negligible.)

The actual number of strings will be less if fewer strings meet the minimum usage threshold ([`--min-string-usage`](#option-min-string-usage))


### `--min-string-usage` <code><em>&lt;NUMBER&gt;</em></code> {#option-min-string-usage}

Value: 1 -- 100,000,000 (default: 300)

Specifies the minimum number of times a string must be used by features (as a tag key or value, or as a role in a relation) in order to be included in the GOL's Global String Table.

See [`--max-strings`](#option-max-strings).


### `-n`, `--min-tile-density` <code><em>&lt;NUMBER&gt;</em></code> {#option-min-tile-density}

Value: 1 -- 10,000,000 (default: 75,000)

If there are fewer nodes in a tile area than this number, the tile will be omitted, and all features in the tile area will be placed into tiles at lower zoom levels. A lower threshold will result in more tiles, up to the maximum specified by [`--max-tiles`](#option-max-tiles).


### `-r`, `--rtree-branch-size` <code><em>&lt;NUMBER&gt;</em></code> {#option-rtree-branch-size}

Value: 1 -- 256 (default: 16)

GOLs use R-tree indexes to accelerate spatial queries. This setting specifies the maximum number of features (or child branches) in each branch (a node in the R-tree). A larger number reduces the size of the GOL, a smaller number increases query performance (but set too low, it may have the opposite effect). Square numbers (4, 9, 16, 25, etc.) tend to perform best.


### `-w`, `--waynode-ids` {#option-waynode-ids}

Stores the IDs for all nodes, including untagged nodes that exist solely to define the geometry of ways. By default, the IDs of such nodes are omitted to save storage space. Option `-w` increases the size of a GOL by about 20%, but is needed to allow updates.

{% include gol/option-silent.md %}

### `-u`, `--updatable` {#option-updatable}

Enables incremental updates to the GOL file (using the [`update`](update.md) command). Setting this option enables [`--waynode-ids`](#option-waynode-ids). It also enables [`--id-indexing`](#option-id-indexing) if the `build` command determines that ID indexes are likely to significantly speed up updating.
